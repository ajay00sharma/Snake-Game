# 🐍 Snake Game Using Pygame  

## 📌 Overview  
This is a **classic Snake Game** built using **Python and Pygame**. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow in size. The goal is to survive as long as possible without hitting the walls or colliding with itself.

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Use **Arrow Keys** to move the snake:
  - ⬆️ **Up Arrow** - Move Up  
  - ⬇️ **Down Arrow** - Move Down  
  - ⬅️ **Left Arrow** - Move Left  
  - ➡️ **Right Arrow** - Move Right  
- The snake grows when it eats an apple.  
- The game ends if the snake **hits the wall** or **collides with itself**.  
- Press **Enter** (↩️) to restart after game over.  
- Press **Escape** (⎋) to exit the game.
